		This is a collection of facts about me: 
		<ul>
			<li> I was born in Bogotá, Colombia</li>
			<li> Studied Pure Mathematics for my bachelor and pursued a Master in that are too.
				My bachelor and master's supervisors were two amazing human beings. Florent Schafhausser and <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/feliper84/" target="blank">Felipe Rincón</a>.
			</li>
			<li> I came to The Netherlands in 2018, but still, alleen een beetje nederlands.</li>
			<li> I came to pursue a Ph.D. in Mathematics following a similar topic that the one on my masters but.... shit happens and life put me in other way.
			</li>
			<li> Always interested in learning and experience new stuff i.e., getting out of the comfort zone. This had led me to try:
	 			<ul>
					 <li>Bouldering.</li>
					 <li>MountainBoarding.</li>
					 <li>Bungee Jumping.</li>
					 <li>Different cusisines: African, Chinese, Vietnamese, Indian, Taiwanese and still so many other to try.</li>
					 <li>Snowboarding</li>
					 <li>Runing a marathon</li>
					 <li>Data Science. From technical view to practice (Soon) </li>
					 <li>Cooking: Vegetarian and vegan cuisine</li>
				</ul>
			</li> 
		</ul>

	</p>

	<p title="Extras">Additionally to my job, I keep yself interested in Data Science and Data visualization topics, experimenting in those ares in my free time. All of those are in line with the intention of using my mathematical background to understand and improve my knkowledge and skills. 


Other activities include: Climbing, Running, Cooking.
